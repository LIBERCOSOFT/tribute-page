  <p><b>Here are some years of facts about Einstein during his life time:</b></p>
  </center>
  <ul>
    <li><b>1879</b> - Born in ulm,Kingdom of Wurttemberg,German Empire</li>
    <li><b>1880</b> - Family moved to Munich,where his father manufactured elictrical equipment based on direct current</li>
    <li><b>1994</b> - Father lost company to a bid because he was not able to provide the people of munich with sufficient power supply due to lack to equipment for converting direct current to alternating current.</li>
    <li><b>1895-96</b> - He attended  Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau.</li>
    <li><b>1896</b> - With his father's approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service and  enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic.</li>
    <li><b>1900</b> - Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma.</li>
    <li><b>1901</b> - He acquired Swiss citizenship but was not conscripted for medical reasons, With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father, Einstein secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office as an assistant examiner.</li>
    <li><b>1903</b> -  Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent and his paper on ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published </li>
    <li><b>1905</b> - He completed his thesis with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor,Also,he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his dissertation entitled, "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions.That same year, which has been called Einstein's annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.</li>
    <li><b>1908</b> - He was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern</li>
    <li><b>1909</b> - Einstein  was appointed associate professor</li>
    <li><b>1911</b> - He  became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April</li>
    <li><b>1912-14</b> - He was professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and his friend Marcel Grossmann.</li>
    <li><b>1914</b> - He returned to the German Empire after being appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics  and a professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin, but freed from most teaching obligations. He soon became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences</li>
    <li><b>1916</b> - He  was appointed president of the German Physical Society</li>
    <li><b>1919</b> - Based on calculations Einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star would be bent by the Sun's gravity, that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: "Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown"</li>
    <li><b>1920</b> -  He became Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.</li>
    <li><b>1921</b> -  Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</li>
    <li><b> 1925 </b>- He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921.[1] He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925 in Germany.</li>
    <li><b>1921-31</b> - He travelled abroad</li>
    <li><b>1933</b> - Emigrated to U.S</li>
    <li><b>1955</b> - Died at the age of 76.</li>
